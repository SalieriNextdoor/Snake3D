# Snake3D

A 3D Snake game made with OpenGL in C++.

## Build
First, the directory Include must be created and library header folders for [glad (for gl 3.3)](https://glad.dav1d.de/), [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) and [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) added. The file glad.c must be added to the Libs directory.

Then, access the src directory within a Linux terminal or MinGW-w64 for Windows and run `make` to build.

## Build docs
To build the documentation, it's needed to have doxygen installed.

Then, access the src directory and run `make docs`.
